//! # Spade
//! Spade (SPAtial Data structurEs, obviously!) implements a few nifty data structures optimized for spatial access operations.
//!
//! # Features
//! * An n-dimensional r*-tree: `spade::rtree::RTree`
//! * A 2D Delaunay triangulation: `spade::delaunay::DelaunayTriangulation`
//!   * Supports integral and floating point coordinates as input
//!   * Uses exact predicates to avoid floating point rounding issues, see `spade::kernels::FloatKernel`
//!   * Natural neighbor interpolation
//!   * Can be backed up by an r*-tree to improve performance when inserting randomly distributed points
//!   * Supports vertex removal
//! * A 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation: `spade::delaunay::ConstrainedDelaunayTriangulation`
//! * Supports serde. Activate the `serde_serialize` feature to enable (de)serialization of r*-trees,
//! (constrained) Delaunay triangulations and primitives.
//!
//! # Supported point types
//! Spade works well with points from the `nalgebra` and `cgmath` packages. Also, fixed size arrays of size 2, 3 and 4 are
//! supported. Also own vector types can be defined.
//! Please note that, due to the way cargo resolves dependencies, there might be issues when using spade combined with cgmath
//! or nalgebra: every time spade updates these libraries, the using code must be update too, even if spade would still work
//!  with the older version. To avoid this, consider switching to fixed size arrays as points until
//! [public / private dependencies make their way into cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44663).
